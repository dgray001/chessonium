v0.1.3: Only one evaluator

## Plans

0.2:
v0.1.4: Split search into different files
v0.1.5: Configure ab into negamax search
v0.1.6: Add evaluator for piece activity (existing move table)
v0.1.7: Add evaluator / configuration for pawn structure cases (doubled pawns, isolated pawns, passed pawns, etc...)
Other evaluator ideas:
  Activity based on which square (not existing move table)
  Activity based on how many squares are attacked
Implement quiesance search configurable on max depth, what constitutes "quiet", etc...
Can read in configuration from file

## Bugs
