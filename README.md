v0.1.11: Transposition table

## Plans

0.2:
Can read in configuration from file
Have engine trade pieces if ahead in material (and avoid if behind)
UI for playing against engine as white or black (timer?)
Add small transposition table (~1gb)

Need to test everything with zobrist hashing (positions seen, moves since zero, 3 move repitition, etc...)

## Bugs

Promoted pawn but nothing happened (need ui for promoting pawn)
