v0.1.7: Piece activity evaluator

## Plans

0.2:
v0.1.7: Add evaluator / configuration for pawn structure cases (doubled pawns, isolated pawns, passed pawns, etc...)
Other evaluator ideas:
  Activity based on which square (not existing move table)
  Activity based on how many squares are attacked
Implement quiesance search configurable on max depth, what constitutes "quiet", etc...
Can read in configuration from file

## Bugs

Also, started getting out of memory errors (!!!) => this may be due to ide or to the crashes since this happened in conjunction with crashes
